# Sales Analysis Portfolio Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes company sales data using **SQL + Python + Pandas + Seaborn**.  
The goal was to investigate a **15% quarterly sales decline** and identify where the drop is happening across regions, products, and customer segments.

## 🎯 Problem
Sales performance dropped ~15% this quarter. Leadership needed clarity on:
- Which **regions** are underperforming
- Which **products** drive or lag sales

## 🔍 Findings

- **Top Products:** Canon imageCLASS copier leads; binding systems & printers follow.

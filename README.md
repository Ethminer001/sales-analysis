# 📈 Sales Performance Analysis

End-to-end analysis of company sales data to diagnose a **15% quarterly sales decline** and deliver actionable recommendations.

Built with SQL + Python + Pandas + Seaborn.

> **Data:** a public Kaggle sales dataset, loaded into MySQL. The business setting ("leadership" asking for answers) is a practice scenario, not a real company. The $15K campaign lift is an expected figure, not a measured result.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Sales dropped ~15% this quarter. Leadership needed answers:

- Which **regions** are underperforming?
- Which **products** are driving or dragging results?
- Which **customer segments** are most impacted?

## 🔍 Key Findings

**Regional Performance**  
- South region declined **23%** — $47K in lost revenue  
- West and East regions remained stable and strong

**Top Products**  
- Canon imageCLASS copier leads overall sales volume  
- Binding systems and printers showed the largest declines

**Customer Segments**  
- Consumer segment dominates revenue but dropped **18%** in the South  
- This segment drove the majority of the regional revenue loss

## ✅ Recommended Actions

1. **Targeted email campaign** to 340 lapsed South-region customers  
   → Expected lift: **$15K** within 60 days

2. **Bundled promotions** on underperforming categories  
   → Binding systems + printers with discount incentives

3. **Consumer segment retention program** in South region  
   → Recover lost share and stabilize performance
